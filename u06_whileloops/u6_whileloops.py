### counting numbers

# count numbers form 0 to 9
# for i in range(10):

# count = 0

# while count < 10:

#     print(count)# output the value of count

#     count = count + 1 # increase the value of count

# # use the while loop and print out numbers from 0 to 5
# count = 0

# while count < 6:

#     print(count)# output the value of count

#     count = count + 1 # increase the value of count


# # use the while loop and print out numbers from 1 to 5
# count = 1

# while count < 6:

# # use the while loop and print out multiples of 5 from 5 to 50
# count = 5

# while count < 51:

# # use the while loop and print out numbers from 10 to 1
